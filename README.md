# Bengaluru_House_Price_Prediction
This project focuses on solving a regression problem to predict house prices in Bengaluru, India. 

The process involved comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing to handle inconsistencies in the dataset. Various models were built and the best was chosen.

To make our solution accessible, we developed MYHOME, a product that includes a web application for predicting house prices and a dashboard for visualizing trends. The web app was built using Flask, with the dashboard implemented using R Shiny. Together, these tools provide an intuitive interface for users to explore and understand the housing market in Bengaluru.
